#### Here is my first attempt at a personal website for Comp20 Assignment 1.
#### I'm happy with how it turned out- I left out some personal information but the skeleton is there.
#### Overall, I wish the spacing was a bit cleaner but that comes down to a lot of guess and check and I felt it would take a lot of time to get perfect.
#### I believe all aspects of this assignemnt were completed as stated in the assignment guidelines.
#### I worked along on this assignment.
#### I spent around 5 hours on this assignment.
